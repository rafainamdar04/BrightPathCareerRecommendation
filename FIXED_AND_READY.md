cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Or use the convenience scripts:**
- Windows: `backend\start_backend.bat`
- Linux/Mac: `bash backend/start_backend.sh`

### Step 2: Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd frontend-vite
npm run dev
```

**Or use the convenience scripts:**
- Windows: `frontend-vite\start_frontend.bat`
- Linux/Mac: `bash frontend-vite/start_frontend.sh`

### Step 3: Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Vite Proxy Configuration
Added missing resume endpoints to `frontend-vite/vite.config.ts`:
- `/upload_resume`
- `/analyze_resume_for_role`
- `/compare_resume_with_roadmap`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** After updating vite.config.ts, you MUST restart the frontend dev server for changes to take effect!

### 2. Backend Error Handling
Enhanced error handling in `/predict_top3_careers` endpoint with detailed error messages and traceback.

### 3. Removed Irrelevant Files
Deleted:
- `frontend-vite/src/pages/CareerRecommendation.tsx.backup`
- `frontend-vite/src/pages/CareerRecommendation.tsx.original`
- `frontend-vite/src/App.tsx.old`
- `backend/nul`

### 4. NLP Resume Analysis
Verified all dependencies are installed and working:
- ✓ spaCy with `en_core_web_sm` model
- ✓ PyPDF2 for PDF parsing
- ✓ docx2txt for DOCX parsing
