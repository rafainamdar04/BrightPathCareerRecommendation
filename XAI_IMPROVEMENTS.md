# XAI Visualization & App Improvements

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **XAI Visualizations Now Work!** 📊

**Backend Changes:**
- ✅ Added missing `preprocess_input()` function in `backend/app/xai.py`
- ✅ Fixed SHAP visualization generation with matplotlib
- ✅ Changed default `generate_visualization` to `True` in the API endpoint
- ✅ Added static file serving in FastAPI (`app.mount("/static", ...)`)
- ✅ Enhanced visualization with better styling (horizontal bar plots, colors)
- ✅ Fixed file saving with proper directory creation

**Frontend Changes:**
- ✅ Added visualization image display in XAI results
- ✅ Visualization images are fetched from backend static files
- ✅ Added auto-scroll to XAI section when loaded
- ✅ Added error handling for missing images

**Result:** SHAP visualizations are now automatically generated and displayed!

## 🐛 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend server running on http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Static files directory created at `backend/static/`
- [ ] matplotlib installed (`pip install matplotlib`)
- [ ] SHAP installed (`pip install shap`)
- [ ] Test visualization generation (check browser console for errors)
- [ ] Test image loading (check Network tab if images don't show)
- [ ] Test download feature in different browsers
- [ ] Test comparison with 2 and 3 careers

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing?
1. Check if static files are being served: http://localhost:8000/static/
2. Check browser console for 404 errors
3. Verify `backend/static/` directory exists
4. Check CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`

### Visualization Not Generated?
1. Check backend logs for matplotlib errors
2. Ensure non-interactive backend: `matplotlib.use('Agg')`
3. Verify SHAP values are being calculated
4. Check file permissions on `backend/static/`

### Download Not Working?
1. Check browser's download settings
2. Try different browser (some block auto-downloads)
3. Check console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify blob creation in browser DevTools
