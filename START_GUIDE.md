## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Port 8000 already in use**: Kill the process using port 8000 or change the port
- **Module not found errors**: Make sure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
- **TensorFlow errors**: The career evolution will fallback to basic model if advanced model fails

### Frontend Issues
- **Port 5173 already in use**: The dev server will automatically use the next available port
- **API connection errors**: Make sure backend is running on port 8000
- **Build errors**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

### Common Errors
- **CORS errors**: Make sure backend is running before starting frontend
- **404 errors**: Check that both servers are running and proxy is configured correctly
- **Blank page**: Check browser console for errors, ensure both servers are running
