# 🎉 FIXES APPLIED - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend-Backend Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Missing proxy configurations in Vite
- **Solution**: Added all required endpoints to `vite.config.ts`:
  - `/predict_career_evolution` 
  - `/static` (for SHAP images)

### 2. Career Evolution Not Accessible
- **Problem**: Career Evolution was a separate page, not integrated with predictions
- **Solution**: Added Career Evolution as a prominent button after top 3 predictions
  - Button location: Top-right of results section
  - Icon: 🚀 Career Evolution
  - Uses same form data - no re-entry needed

### 3. Missing API Integration
- **Problem**: Frontend lacked career evolution API call
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `evolution` API function in CareerRecommendation.tsx
  - Added state management for evolution data
  - Added loading and error states
  - Added evolution display section with timeline visualization
